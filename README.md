# Fraud Transaction Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
- Transaction dataset with over 6.3 million records
- Highly imbalanced fraud classification problem

## Approach
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Stratified sampling to handle large data size
- Random Forest classifier with class balancing
- Evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## Key Insights
- Transaction type and amount are strong fraud indicators
- Sudden balance depletion is a common fraud pattern

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
